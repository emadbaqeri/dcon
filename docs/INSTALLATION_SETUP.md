# üéØ Complete Installation Setup Guide

This document explains the complete setup for automated binary building and seamless user installation.

## üèóÔ∏è What's Been Set Up

### 1. GitHub Workflows

#### **Semantic Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml`)
- Triggers on pushes to `main` branch
- Analyzes conventional commits
- Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
- Updates version in `Cargo.toml`
- **NEW**: Automatically triggers binary build workflow after creating a release

#### **Binary Build Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Triggers on:
  - Tag pushes (`v*.*.*`)
  - Manual dispatch (for existing releases)
  - **NEW**: Automatic trigger from semantic-release
- Builds binaries for all 6 platform combinations
- Uploads binaries to GitHub release with correct naming

### 2. Installation Scripts

#### **Unix Script** (`scripts/install.sh`)
- Auto-detects OS (macOS/Linux) and architecture (x86_64/aarch64)
- Downloads correct binary from GitHub releases
- Installs to `~/.local/bin`
- Updates PATH automatically
- Comprehensive error handling

#### **Windows PowerShell** (`scripts/install.ps1`)
- Auto-detects architecture (x86_64/ARM64)
- Downloads correct Windows binary
- Installs to `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`
- Updates user PATH environment variable
- Full error handling and verification

#### **Windows Batch** (`scripts/install.bat`)
- Alternative for users who prefer batch files
- Same functionality as PowerShell script

#### **One-liner** (`scripts/install-oneliner.sh`)
- Simple curl-based installation for Unix systems

### 3. Documentation
- **`INSTALL.md`**: Comprehensive installation guide for users
- **`docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`**: Developer guide for release process
- **Updated `README.md`**: Quick installation instructions

## üöÄ How It Works

### For Users (Installation)
```bash
# macOS & Linux - One command installation
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emadbaqeri/dcon/main/scripts/install-oneliner.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell - One command installation  
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emadbaqeri/dcon/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### For You (Development & Release)
```bash
# 1. Make changes with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add new awesome feature"
git push origin main

# 2. Semantic-release automatically:
#    - Determines version bump
#    - Creates GitHub release
#    - Triggers binary build workflow
#    - Uploads 6 platform binaries

# 3. Users can immediately install the new version!
```

## üîß Binary Naming Convention

The workflows build and upload binaries with these exact names:

| Platform | Binary Name |
|----------|-------------|
| Linux x86_64 | `dcon-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux ARM64 | `dcon-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| macOS Intel | `dcon-x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `dcon-aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Windows x86_64 | `dcon-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |
| Windows ARM64 | `dcon-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Push the Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive cross-platform installation system

- Add automated binary building for 6 platform combinations
- Create installation scripts for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Set up workflow integration with semantic-release
- Add comprehensive installation documentation

BREAKING CHANGE: Installation process now uses pre-built binaries instead of requiring Rust toolchain"

git push origin main
```

### 2. Test the Binary Build (Manual Trigger)
After pushing, you can manually trigger binary building for v1.0.0:
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run release.yml --field tag="v1.0.0"

# Or via the trigger script (after pushing)
./scripts/trigger-binary-build.sh v1.0.0
```

### 3. Verify Installation Scripts
Once binaries are uploaded, test the installation:
```bash
# Test on different systems
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emadbaqeri/dcon/main/scripts/install-oneliner.sh | bash
```

## üîÑ Future Releases

For all future releases, the process is completely automated:

1. **Commit with conventional messages** ‚Üí Push to main
2. **Semantic-release** ‚Üí Creates GitHub release
3. **Binary workflow** ‚Üí Builds and uploads 6 binaries automatically
4. **Users** ‚Üí Can immediately install with one command

## üéâ Benefits

- **Zero manual work** for releases after initial setup
- **Cross-platform support** out of the box
- **Professional installation experience** for users
- **No Rust toolchain required** for end users
- **Consistent binary naming** across all platforms
- **Automatic PATH management** in installation scripts
- **Comprehensive error handling** and verification
